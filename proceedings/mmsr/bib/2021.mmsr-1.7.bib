  abstract  = {In recent years several corpora have been developed for vision and language tasks. With this paper, we intend to start a discussion on the annotation of referential phenomena in situated dialogue. We argue that there is still significant room for corpora that increase the complexity of both visual and linguistic domains and which capture different varieties of perceptual and conversational contexts. In addition, a rich annotation scheme covering a broad range of referential phenomena and compatible with the textual task of coreference resolution is necessary in order to take the most advantage of these corpora. Consequently, there are several open questions regarding the semantics of reference and annotation, and the extent to which standard textual coreference accounts for the situated dialogue genre. Working with two corpora on situated dialogue, we present our extension to the ARRAU (Uryupina et al., 2020) annotation scheme in order to start this discussion.},
